# Minesweeper_Parody Functions
C++ program that mimics minesweeper but instead of mines it is geese. 

This program utilises concepts in arrays and bitwise operators to perform necessary changes to fields on a n x n board set by the user.
The functions here were called in another program (not created by me) that allowed for proper gameplay similar to that of minesweeper.
